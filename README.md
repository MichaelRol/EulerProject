# EulerProject
My attempts at solving the problems set out on the Euler Project: https://projecteuler.net/

They are all (currently) written in Python 2.7 - so can all be run using "python xx-programname.py".

I aim for all solutions to abide by the minute rule, I only consider a solution complete if it can run on a standard processor in under a minute. 

All code is self-documenting.
